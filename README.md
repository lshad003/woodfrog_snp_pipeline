# 🧬 woodfrog_snp_pipeline

This repository contains a modular SNP association analysis pipeline tailored for species-level investigations in the wood frog (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) gut metagenome project.

## 📌 Project Goal

To identify SNPs in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that are associated with the presence of *Basidiobolus*, a fungal symbiont, across experimental treatments.
